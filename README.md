🌍 Wildfire CO2 Flux Analysis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2023–2024) 🔥

I developed a workflow to analyze daily wildfire CO2 flux from GFAS NetCDF data over the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The pipeline includes reading shapefiles, preprocessing NetCDF data, aggregating daily fluxes to monthly means, converting raster data to tidy data frames, creating detailed maps and line plots, and exporting results as GeoTIFFs and CSVs for further analysis.

🎥 Purpose of the video: Many students and researchers struggle to extract data for their own regions of interest (ROI). This video demonstrates a step-by-step workflow to simplify the process and resolve those challenges.
