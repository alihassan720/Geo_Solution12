🚀 Excited to share a new YouTube tutorial I created for students and researchers working with climate and wildfire data! 🌍🔥

Many struggle with extracting information from NetCDF files, especially for GFAS (Global Fire Assimilation System) Wildfire CO₂ data. To help, I’ve made a short and practical video showing how to easily extract data, make maps, and generate graphs in R for the California region.

✨ This video also shows you how to create high-quality maps and graphs that are publication-ready — no extra editing needed! 📊🗺️

🎥 Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYkEXtGevEo

I hope this will be a useful resource for those working in environmental science, wildfire research, remote sensing, and climate studies. 🙌
